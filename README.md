# Personal Finance Dashboard 

The goal of this Personal Finance Dashboard is to have a better understanding of spending habits and predict future spending on a monthly basis. 



Creating a dashboard to gain better insight of spending habits. 
I have collected my spending data for 9 months and would like to get a better understanding of the types of purchases I am making, when I am spending the most/least, and if there are any patterns I'm missing. 
This will be a webapp created with Streamlit for better data vsualization and functionality to be able to be updated and refined on a monthly basis.
